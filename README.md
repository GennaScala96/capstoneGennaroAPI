This is an explanantion on how to start my "joke name" website. I actually don't know where to look for a proper joke name but i just got general jokes for an input.
fo any advice on how to do it, please leave an explanation, thanks.

1) Firt of all open VSCode and start the terminal and add the correct route for the directory.
2) Start the server by installing all the npm dependecies.
3) Run "npx nodemon idex.js" and have fun :)
